# Python-Project-to-demonstrate-AND-and-OR-functions-and-draw-Activation-Functions
This was another academic Project which I pursued in my 3rd semester to draw activation functions upon the demonstration of AND-and-OR functions. The Project was coded using python programming on Jupyter Notebooks where I Use Neural network for implantation of ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ functions by using Python language. Output is shown in a graph (for visualization of ‘AND’ and ‘OR’) and also Shows the equation of the line - Mention the weight, What is the bias, Show the calculation in a table as well 2. I also Use Python to draw Activation functions - Sigmoid - Hyperbolic tangent - ReLU and  A graph to superimpose all three.
